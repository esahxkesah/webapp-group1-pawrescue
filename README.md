## Introduction

In our country, Malaysian citizens must at least once see a quite number of cats and dogs roaming around looking so smudged and pitiful on the street when we are outside, especially at the outdoor restaurant, park, neighborhood and so on. They are considered and called stray animals that can include lost animals that were unable to find their way home, street animals that are born and breed on the streets and have never been owned, or abandoned animals that are no longer desired and are left on the streets or brought to a shelter by their owner. Stray animals are not limited to just cats and dogs but it also can be an exotic pet like fennec fox and hedgehog that stray around without observation. Reproduction among stray animals that gets out of hand can raise their number and will cause a lot of complications which increases the likelihood of predation, auto accidents, the spread of zoonotic illnesses, and hence, their potential to serve as disease vectors. 

One of our proposed approaches is by making an web application to help, save, protect the animals and the environment which is called PawRescue. PawRescue web application will work together with animal shelters to help stray animals to get treated, to get helped and to get protected. This web application also is going to have some user-friendly features and information that everybody can use. We are gonna post and update the upcoming events concerning the stray animalsâ€™ welfare aside from adoption and volunteer feature and our rescued pets information. For the adopt feature, users can adopt animals that they find adorable for free by using their registered account which can also be made for free. The event feature will be prepared for those who voluntarily want to take part in our operation officially. Other than that, users can also make a report on any concerning animals that need help that they witness.


## Objective

The objective of PawRescue web application project is to create a better community which includes the environment and animals through application technology and to gather voluntary society who are in for the better sake of stray animals in our society.
